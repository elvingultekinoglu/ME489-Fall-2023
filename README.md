# ME489
This repository consists of the assignments and coursework from the ME489 Scientific Programming course I took during the Fall semester of 2023–2024 in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Middle East Technical University.

Throughout the course, the fundamentals of parallel programming were taught, and grading was based on various projects. All assignments and coursework were completed using Ubuntu 20.04.
